# **Beamforming Simulator**

Beamforming is a pivotal technology in modern systems like wireless communications, radar, ultrasound, and biomedical applications. This project presents a **2D Beamforming Simulator** that allows users to explore, customize, and visualize beamforming scenarios in real time. The simulator provides intuitive controls, flexible customization, and clear visualizations for various applications.

## **Features**

### **Core Functionality**
- **Beam Steering**: Customize steering angles in real time with visual feedback.  
- **Phased Array Geometry**: Choose between linear and curved arrays, with adjustable curvature parameters.  
- **Constructive/Destructive Interference Mapping**: Visualize the beam profile and interference map in synchronized views.  
- **Multiple Array Units**: Add multiple phased array units, each with adjustable parameters and locations.

## **Scenarios**

The simulator supports three distinct scenarios, each designed to address specific applications of beamforming:

### **1. 5G Communications**
- **Objective**: Simulate a beamforming scenario where the system focuses on signals originating from a desired steering angle.  
- **Explanation**: In 5G communications, it’s common to target a specific user or signal source while allowing other signals to exist in different angles. The simulator demonstrates how beamforming can isolate the desired signal while maintaining the presence of others. This scenario highlights constructive interference in the target angle and the corresponding destructive patterns elsewhere.  
- **Key Parameters**:
  - Multiple operating frequencies.
  - Adjustable steering angles for signal focus.
  - Visualization of interference patterns.

### **2. Ultrasound Imaging**
- **Objective**: Model a beamforming scenario where the system produces wide signals covering a specific range in the desired direction.  
- **Explanation**: Ultrasound imaging requires beams that span a range to provide a complete image. In this scenario, the simulator generates wide beams that ensure the entire target area is covered. It also ensures the frequency is optimized for patient safety, avoiding side effects from excessive energy levels.  
- **Key Parameters**:
  - Adjustable beam width to cover a larger range.
  - Frequencies fine-tuned for safe medical use.
  - Synchronized visualization of beam profile and interference map.

### **3. Tumor Ablation**
- **Objective**: Simulate a narrow, focused beam targeting a specific cell or area.  
- **Explanation**: Tumor ablation involves using highly targeted beams to destroy cancerous cells without affecting surrounding healthy tissue. The simulator generates a narrow beam with high precision in the desired steering angle. Like the ultrasound scenario, the operating frequency is chosen carefully to ensure no harmful side effects occur.  
- **Key Parameters**:
  - Narrow beam width for precise targeting.
  - High accuracy to prevent interaction with adjacent cells.
  - Adjustable array curvature for optimal focus.
