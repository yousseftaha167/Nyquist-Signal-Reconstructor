## Features

### 1. **Signal Sampling & Reconstruction**
   - **Original Signal Display:** Visualize the original signal with sampling points marked.
   - **Reconstructed Signal:** View the reconstructed signal using selectable interpolation methods.
   - **Difference Graph:** Toggle between the difference plot and side-by-side comparison of original and reconstructed signals.
   - **Frequency Domain Analysis:** Inspect the frequency domain to detect aliasing.

### 2. **Signal Mixer/Composer**
   - Generate new signals by:
     - Selecting the number of terms (sinusoidal components).
     - Defining frequency, amplitude, and phase for each component.
   - Remove individual components to modify the signal dynamically.

### 3. **Customizable Sampling Frequency**
   - Adjust the sampling frequency using a slider.
   - Toggle between absolute frequency $(Hz)$ and normalized frequency $(% of \(f_{max}\))$.
   - Quickly set valid sampling frequencies $(\(f_s \geq 2f_{max}\))$ with a dedicated button.

### 4. **Interpolation Methods**
   - Explore reconstruction techniques:
     - Shannon Interpolation
     - Lanczos Interpolation
     - Step Interpolation
   - Compare performance, pros, and cons of each method.

### 5. **Noise Control**
   - Add noise to the signal using an SNR slider.
   - Observe the impact of noise on the reconstructed signal and frequency domain.

### 6. **Real-time Updates**
   - Instantaneous updates to all plots when parameters are changed.

### 7. **Resizable UI**
   - Responsive and flexible user interface that adapts seamlessly to resizing.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Load or Compose a Signal:**
   - Use the "Composer" to create a new signal by specifying sinusoidal terms, frequencies, amplitudes, and phases.
   - Alternatively, load a signal from a file.

2. **Set Sampling Parameters:**
   - Adjust the sampling frequency using the slider or set a valid sampling frequency with the quick toggle button.
   - Toggle between Hz and normalized $\(f_{max}\)$ display.

3. **Add Noise (Optional):**
   - Use the SNR slider to introduce noise and observe its effects.

4. **Reconstruct Signal:**
   - Choose an interpolation method from the dropdown menu.
   - Compare the reconstructed signal with the original using the difference graph.

5. **Analyze Results:**
   - Inspect the frequency domain for aliasing.
   - View differences between the original and reconstructed signals.

## Testing Scenarios

### 1. **2Hz + 6Hz Sinusoids**
   - Expected Behavior:
     - **12Hz Sampling:** Perfect reconstruction.
     - **4Hz Sampling:** Aliasing occurs, showing a single frequency.
     - **8Hz Sampling:** Partial reconstruction with visible artifacts.

### 2. **High-frequency Signal with Noise**
   - Mix of high-frequency components.
   - Add varying levels of noise to demonstrate reconstruction performance under noisy conditions.

### 3. **Multiple Frequencies with Small Gaps**
   - Demonstrates the limitations of reconstruction when frequencies are close to the Nyquist limit.
